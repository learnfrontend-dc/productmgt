First function returns a disposable resource.\n * It can be an arbitrary object that implements `unsubscribe` method. Second function will be injected with\n * that object and should return an Observable. That Observable can use resource object during its execution.\n * Both functions passed to `using` will be called every time someone subscribes - neither an Observable nor\n * resource object will be shared in any way between subscriptions.\n *\n * When Observable returned by `using` is subscribed, Observable returned from the second function will be subscribed\n * as well. All its notifications (nexted values, completion and error events) will be emitted unchanged by the output\n * Observable. If however someone unsubscribes from the Observable or source Observable completes or errors by itself,\n * the `unsubscribe` method on resource object will be called. This can be used to do any necessary clean up, which\n * otherwise would have to be handled by hand. Note that complete or error notifications are not emitted when someone\n * cancels subscription to an Observable via `unsubscribe`, so `using` can be used as a hook, allowing you to make\n * sure that all resources which need to exist during an Observable execution will be disposed at appropriate time.\n *\n * @see {@link defer}\n *\n * @param {function(): ISubscription} resourceFactory A function which creates any resource object\n * that implements `unsubscribe` method.\n * @param {function(resource: ISubscription): Observable<T>} observableFactory A function which\n * creates an Observable, that can use injected resource object.\n * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that behaves the same as Observable returned by `observableFactory`, but\n * which - when completed, errored or unsubscribed - will also call `unsubscribe` on created resource object.\n */\nexport function using(resourceFactory, observableFactory) {\n    return new Observable(function (subscriber) {\n        var resource;\n        try {\n            resource = resourceFactory();\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            subscriber.error(err);\n            return undefined;\n        }\n        var result;\n        try {\n            result = observableFactory(resource);\n        }\n        catch (err) {\n            subscriber.error(err);\n            return undefined;\n        }\n        var source = result ? from(result) : EMPTY;\n        var subscription = source.subscribe(subscriber);\n        return function () {\n            subscription.unsubscribe();\n            if (resource) {\n                resource.unsubscribe();\n            }\n        };\n    });\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=using.js.map\n",null]}
